# Task 1

**ML Task #1**

*Problem Statement:* :bomb:

Using linear regression for rank predictions!

In this type of machine learning task, the objective of the computer program is to predict a numerical value given some input. Linear regression models can often be fitted using the least squares approach but they can also be fitted in other ways!

Keeping that in mind and in the spirit of the FIFA football world cup finally kicking off, it's time to make some rank predictions!

Here's a dataset for FIFA Rankings for the past 25 years: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/tadhgfitzgerald/fifa-international-soccer-mens-ranking-1993now)

Normal Mode: :relaxed:
```
Your task is to make a prediction on the rank of a team. 
It can based on a number of independent variables for which data is available in the dataset.
```
Hacker Mode: :fire:
```
Optimize your results!
Use more than one independent variable for the Hacker Mode.
Hint: Ridge/Lasso-based regularisation is one such optimization
```

Submission: :date:
```
You are required to program in Python for the above task.
Normal Mode is required. Hacker Mode is highly encouraged :)
Deadline: 24th June 2018
```

Required Skills: :muscle:
```
1. Python
```
 
Limitations: :worried:
```
Usage of libraries that offer linear regression fitting functions out of the box is not allowed.
```
# Happy coding! :blush:
